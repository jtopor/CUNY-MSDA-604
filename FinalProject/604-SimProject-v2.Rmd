# =====================================================
# 1 set of purchases - 5 to 25 books (simulated book widths)

# =====================================================
# 1 set of textbook purchases (simulated book widths) - 2 copies of 3 to 5 books

# 1 round of de-dup: Num of vols de-duped based on number of textbooks purchased

# =====================================================
# 1 round of check-ins - 2% of the collection gets checked in (not the same as the check outs)

# 1 round of check-outs - 2% of the collection gets newly checked out
